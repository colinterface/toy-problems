// Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:
//
// The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
// The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
// For example, if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.
//
// Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
//
// No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
